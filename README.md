### "Real Programmer's DVORAK" layout programmed for the Advantage 360 (non-pro).

The Smartset application is pretty rough, and the firmware is limited; so I used macros where needed to get the layout working.
Please not the change of the [-_] placement to maintain the arrow keys, for now.

I added support for copy, paste, cut, undo, switch (alt-tab) and snip (win/cmd+shift+s). Using SHIFT + any of these macros is also defined to work as expected (FN+SHIFT+Z = Redo, etc).
I have a Mac version I am dialing in as well, and a linux version intended for use with i3.

To use, rename the layout_{OS}.txt file to a layout and place it on your adv360's v-drive, overwriting the layout you want to replace. Make sure to refresh the adv360 afterwards.
