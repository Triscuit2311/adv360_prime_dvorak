### Real Programmer's DVORAK" layout programmed for the Advantage 360 (non-pro).

The Smartset application is pretty rough, and the firmware is limited; so I used macros where needed to get the layout working.

This layout shown on adv360 (only using the ZMK gui for visual layout, this repo does NOT include files for ZMK)
